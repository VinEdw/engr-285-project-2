# ENGR 285 --- Project 2

This repository contains my group's work for Project 2 of my Engineering 285 class.
The assignment focuses on modeling realistic projectiles that experience quadratic drag.

The document is created using [Typst](https://typst.app/).
A `makefile` is configured to run all the Python scripts in the `scripts` directory and save their text output in the `output` directory.
The scripts and output can then be included in the document as desired.
The `makefile` also compiles the Typst document into a PDF.

## Comments from Professor

> First Objective:
> Good theoretical and phenomenological discussions of interdependence of motion.
> 
> Second Objective:
> As looks to be the case in a fair amount of the report, itâ€™s a shame that you didnâ€™t go high enough in velocities to be able to deduce the high velocity limit where the trajectories approach a right-triangular form; the graphs do nicely show the transition from nearly-free-fall at low speeds to visible asymmetry at near terminal speeds.
> 
> Third Objective:
> Nice job extracting the range here; could have done with a bit of discussion of what character of error is to be expected when modeling the trajectory as a straight line.
> 
> Fourth Objective:
> A nice graph, but again, it would be nice to have a graph for even higher velocities to show that there is no lower bound to the optimal angle.
> 
> Fifth Objective:
> A good discussion of the re-ordering of the angles as speed increases, and the graph is a small enough scale to see the initial quadratic behavior of the near-free-fall range.
> Apologies for the broken record, but some characterization of the overall shape/trend of the higher velocities would have been nice.
> 
> Extending Objective:
> Excellent implementation, very thoughtfully coded!
> The variation with target angle was particularly interesting; the minimum launch speed appears to be a rather interesting function of target angle.
> 
> Overall:
> Like I mentioned a few times above, to make this project perfect there needed to be a bit more attention to the high velocity limiting behavior (matching the attention given to the low velocity limiting behavior); but otherwise very well done!
